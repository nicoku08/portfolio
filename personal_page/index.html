        Hello, My name is Nicolas Ku. I am a Junior at Rutgers University in NJ working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
      I enjoy working on programming both for school and outside where I like to learn new things that are not taught in the school curriculum.
      I am efficient with Java and Python but also working on learning web development using HTML,CSS and Javascript using the MERN stack for the full development.
